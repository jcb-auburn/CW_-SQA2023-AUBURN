Report of Activities:
10/21/2023 - Jason created repo and worked on 4.a (Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed)
10/23/2023 - Wilson and Cody added to repo
10/30/2023 - Jason pushed pre-commit file to the repo. Did not work because of security issues, so "pre-commit.txt" is what we are using for now
