# Report of Activities:
- 10/21/2023 - Jason created repo and worked on 4.a (Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed)
- 10/23/2023 - Wilson and Cody added to repo
- 10/30/2023 - Jason pushed pre-commit file to the repo. Did not work because of security issues, so "pre-commit.txt" is what we are using for now
- 10/30/2023 - Cody checked Jason's git hooks for part 4.a and they worked. Cody also started working on 4.b (fuzzing)
- 10/31/2023 - Cody completed 4.b by creating 'fuzz.py' and another branch named 'Cody'. The group plans to merge main, Cody, and Wilson branches together once everyone checks each others work 
- 11/02/2023 - Cody and Wilson met through Discord and discussed what else needs to be done 
- 11/03/2023 - Cody pushed updated 4.b solution to branch 'Cody'
- 11/04/2023 - Wilson started working on 4.c (forensics)
- 11/05/2023 - Wilson had trouble with getting his code to work on his computer, so he pushed what he had to branch Wilson.
- 11/15/2023 - Cody helped Wilson fix his issue. Cody and Wilson discovered the issue was with main.py, so they ended up running graphtaint.py and scanner.py individually and running forensics that way. 1 method from scanner.py has forensics and 4 methods from graphtaint.py have forensics.
