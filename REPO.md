Report of Activities:
10/21/2023 - Jason created repo and worked on 4.a (Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed)
10/23/2023 - Wilson and Cody added to repo
10/30/2023 - Jason pushed pre-commit file to the repo. Did not work because of security issues, so "pre-commit.txt" is what we are using for now
10/30/2023 - Cody checked Jason's git hooks for part 4.a and they worked. Cody also started working on 4.b (fuzzing)
10/31/2023 - Cody completed 4.b by creating 'fuzz.py' and another branch named 'Cody'. The group plans to merge main, Cody, and Wilson branches together once everyone checks each others work
11/02/2023 - Cody and Wilson met through Discord and discussed what else needs to be done
11/03/2023 - Cody pushed updated 4.b solution to branch 'Cody'
